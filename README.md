It allows users to:
1. Buy NFT-based event tickets securely using blockchain.

📊 Pitch Deck
UbuntuPass is a decentralized platform that transforms cultural experiences into opportunities for healing. Built on the Hedera Hashgraph network, it enables users to buy event tickets as NFTs, where every purchase contributes directly to funding medical bills for individuals in need. The project bridges entertainment, empathy, and transparency — allowing people to enjoy concerts, art exhibitions, and festivals while making a measurable social impact.
