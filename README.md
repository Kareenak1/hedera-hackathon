 🩵 UbuntuPass – Healing Through Culture
> Buy a Ticket. Heal a Life.

UbuntuPass is a decentralized platform built on **Hedera Hashgraph** that connects cultural experiences to social impact.  
Every time a user buys a ticket for a concert, art show, or cultural festival, a portion of their purchase funds medical bills for individuals in need — 
bringing the Ubuntu spirit (“I am because we are”) to life.
 🌍 Overview
UbuntuPass merges culture, technology, and compassion.  
It allows users to:
1. Buy NFT-based event tickets securely using blockchain.
2. Automatically donate a percentage to verified medical causes.
3. Track impact transparently through the Hedera network.

Each event is an opportunity to **heal a life** and **celebrate community** through collective giving.
